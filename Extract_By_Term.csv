There are certain topics such as salary negotiation which are taughtfrom a managerial perspective which doesn't really make sense at this stage\xe2\x80\x93 we're being taught why employeeswould negotiate certain things and how to deal with that, but we have never learned how to deal with salary negotiationfrom the employee perspective (ie. in a practical way so we can actually employ this knowledge when we go out and getour first jobs. Why am I learning how to be a manager at this stage? I can't even get an entry\xe2\x80\x93level job). Either way,(continuing with the topic of salary negotiation but this applies to other topics as well) the teaching focuses on thetheory rather than practical applications and strategies.

The role plays in this class kind of steer it into a more practical direction, but Idon't think it's quite there because the teaching focuses too much on theory rather than application so it doesn't reallyhelp us do the role play as well as it could.Other than the above, there are some small things I feel aren't conducive to learning. Assignments are excessivelystructured. Why should a 2.5 page paper have 5 pages of instructions on what to include? As well, why are we notallowed to screenshot graphs presented in papers to use in our presentations, but have to recreate them ourselves?Class discussion and activities were beneficial to my learning.Assignments are repetitive and graded inconsistently.

Not really surewhat the professor is expecting.The course was interesting and stimulating from the role plays and lectures but the course didn\'t seem to be muchabout leadership skills.Very goodThe ""coupon"" element is highly distracting. Also the professor commonly preferred to pick students who she preferredanswers from. This lead to her skipping and not choosing other students and limiting their chances for coupons. Theexample was not a one time occurrence, but rather occurred multiple times throughout the course and potentially tomore than one student. This is relevant due to the disproportionate number of coupons some students have comparedto others. Also considering the class size of 40+, it is unlikely that the professor asks for 40+ questions or at least 40+opportunities to speak. The result is that not everyone has an equal possibility to earn coupons, especially when theprofessor plays favorites. This is ultimately very discouraging to students and is an inherently unfair system. It ispossible that on average there was an adequate number of coupons per student, but I believe that this figure is mostlyoffset by the larger number of coupons that a small number of students earn. Also the seemly conflicting answers that the professor talks about the roleplay and what are the slides. It is difficult toget concise and accurate answers on what to state on the final considering the fact that the final is primarily based onthem. Considering there are two different lectures, it is difficult to know which classes are more or less applicable towhat the professor wants on the final, as it is with other discussion heavy courses. It is also confusing why there issuch a heavy emphasis on psychology for a Human Resources course in management. Despite the workshops, thenature of the writings/written material are inherently different especially in the research materials aspect. But what reallyset it apart in a negative way was, the fact that the professor expected scientific processes and methods thatmanagement students are not trained in and are not usually expected fluent in seemed unfair. The strange heavy focuson psychology made it confusing as to what is expected of students and what to make of the course. It also made thecourse too dissimilar to other managements.The professor was average She tried her best, but I feel as though a lot of the course was subjective (ie. participationmarks). I\'m the type of student that doesn\'t like to participate in class, which made going to this class increase mystress levels. Truthfully, I didn\'t learn much from this course. Will most likely learn the material on my own for the finalexam.8.

Her method of counting participation in class is extremely juvenile, and does not reflect university academicstandards. Her assignments are derived from nothing which relates to management skills. There is nothing in the twoassignments which reflect management, or any of its faucets. The course seemed like a psychology course withrespect to the assignments, and honestly has taught me nothing. I strongly urge the management department at UTSC,to remove this course from its core curriculum, to remove it as a mandatory degree requirement and to teach theprofessor on how to develop an engaging course.

She is good at engaging students and creating an active atmosphere inclass, this quality is important for a teacher. Besides, the only improvement needed is about the short answer questions inmidterm. Almost 80% of them focus on one case that we talk in class early. It makes the test ""narrow"" but not ""comprehensive""since students who only focus on studying this case but not other chapter can get a high score.My suggestion is to allocate the weight of each chapter evenly to the short answer questions.Teaching was not textbook based, but instead are full of real\xe2\x80\x93life case studies, which provides more interactions between us. Also itmakes this boring course more interestingthe instructor was effective in providing examples as enhancement to my understanding. real life situations after every topic helpedme to develop a realistic perspective and put the topic into context instead of just a theory. each week had a journal componentreflecting on the content which I thought was helpful however it often had a deadline shortly after class which i struggled with as idid not always have access to a laptop or computer.The lectures were not very clear, I had to rely on the textbook for my learning8.

The instruction she gave was really unclear and confusing.Im going to be honest, the professor was completely useless in terms of learning the course material. She should not even bequalified to teach ANY course ever again. I understand that she is getting paid handsomely based on her academic research andbackground, but she was not able to translate that knowledge effectively in class. I will never take another course with her again.She is definitely the worst professor in terms of learning and helping the class understand the material. For example, we wereassigned a group project. We had previously skyped her multiple times asking her and confirming the information we needed topresent. During the call, she told us that the info is correct and how we should present it effectively. We literally presented what shehad told us to do and for some reason, she has the guts to tell us that our group did not provide the correct graphs and data.the overall quality of the instruction in this course is great.

She helped us with any problems and the exam was fairly testedand I would take another course with this professor.Professor R did a fairly good job in explaining concepts and making the class interactive so that we would learn from the exercisesdone in class. She incorporated many activities that made it more interesting than a plain 2 hour lecture. She could be a little moreclear when explaining what is expected of us in assignments and exams though. It was difficult to understand exactly what shewanted in our assignment and it led to confusion amongst many students. Overall, she showed great enthusiasm in the courseand tried to make the class catered towards ensuring the students found the content stimulating so I appreciate that.It was okConcepts were very similar and made it unable do differentiate ideas and terms. Even after asking the professor for a betterexplanation, answers were vague. I am not the only person who thinks this. My entire section of 10 students was usually veryconfused.I felt my time was wasted for this course, I can't understand the meaning of this course and no interest in it at all. Every week's classwe have to do a journal to get a participation mark, that's a lot of work to do. Sometimes it is a group participation work, it reallysucks cuz one of my group members never did the work, she only hopes others to do it. I hate this course, it makes me stressful,especially in the final group work when you meet lazy ppl, you have to do a lot of extra work. And you still can't find the meaning ofthis course.This prof introduced several times that she graduated from Dr. at Illinois University. She played her speech video which made in2002, Idk why she always emphasis her honor to students in class. It seemed that she is addicted to glory......the instruction in this class was extremely poor. Dr. R is a fantastic person who is very kind and passionate about her field of study,although the teaching in this class was BAD. Every class the instruction for in\xe2\x80\x93class journals very unclear, every class member ofthe class would have to clear multiple times in order to figure out what was needed to be done and the objective remained unclearmost of the time. the final project was a mess, the directions were so unclear and she gave a lecture to better clarify the final projectbut it made the problem worse even more confusing. in my opinion, we learned very little during class time, class time was spentplaying games to highlight the lecture objective rather than actually going over the terms and definitions in greater depth.

Although, I feel she makes us do too manyjournal questions especially during the second class. The journal questions do not really help us understand thematerial as they are usually written before she explains the topic. It is more a precursor to the material and more forparticipation rather than learning.The assignments were useless in relation to the course material. The prof didn't teach us anything relevant to theassignments that we had to complete. Much of the course incorporated STATS material instead of qualitative info aboutorganizational behavior.I have heard and know that the Professor is an astounded researcher. This being said, I was disappointed in theinstruction of the course and felt it was below UofT standards. The professor would breeze over the lecture slides neverstopping to showcase an important concept.

I like the course because it has a lot to explore and run. But the midtermand final exams which are worth 30% and 40% each are only 30 and 35 mark exams which makes it really difficult to assess theimportance of each questions and how much focus should be put in each questions. Also, once the exam is graded \xe2\x80\x93 studentsreceived grade like 1.723/2 which doesn't really seem like a grade but rather arbitrary numerical numbers. I think if the gradingsystem could be set differently \xe2\x80\x93 this course will be much better than what it is.Unclear instructions on most assignments/exams ... deducted marks from lack of application to the readings when we were notcommunicated to apply the readings in class or in instructions for most of the evaluations.Cases helped to give real life examples of certain negotiation situations we might encounter in the future.While the idea of teaching negotiations with hands\xe2\x80\x93on role plays is certainly the best way, it would have been helpful to providesome concepts for a structured approach earlier on, as the role plays are otherwise mostly unstructured and inefficient trial anderror. And as the cases differ too much in situations and necessary techniques one could not even learn why certain approaches toa particular problem actually work or if it was just a coincidence. E.g. it would have helped to introduce the PAST model after the firstgroup negotiation to give the students some tries in implementing it while not wasting too much time on unstructured arguments.Similarily while it was good to learn about some background concepts and techniques that play a role, it would be great to get someframeworks and as above, structured approaches that help in conducting the negotiations to avoid getting lost in trying toimplement certain strategies at certain points in real\xe2\x80\x93life negotiations. E.g. if one does not have a benchmark of how an efficient,structured negotiation can work it is easy to get lost in details and in having to react to the other party's strategies.8.

I did not enjoy having to present in front of a camera, I did not consent to be filmed forthe group presentation and having it available to the rest of 80 students.

For the most part, the class atmospherewas very open to discussion which helped facilitate learning. I would have liked to see more supplemental work to help solidify theconcepts we learned (e.g. weekly practice questions). The midterm questions were also very ambiguous in their wording whichmade it hard to demonstrate that I understood the concepts presented in class. That being said, overall Dr. R was a great profThe instructor does not listen to students' questions and opinions. The professor only cares that every student needs to take in heropinion. Although she pretends to encourage everyone to speak in the class, she often just refute the student and say that it's justsupposed to be what she says in the class. She also does not give clear instructions for any assignments. The grading ofassignments is also graded by very generalized scales and the feedback often has criteria that were not in the task description. Shewanted us to tasks that she believe is useful for the career, but the fact that she is super restricted towards everything just killed anypossibilities. Everything happened in this course was a huge confusion. The main reason is due to the professor. She even suggested one of my friends in dropping the course. I believe this is not what Iwanted for in such a high ranked university. I highly regret taking this course with this professor. I believe my first exposure to theHuman Resources stream could be made better if it is taught by other professors.

It is understandable to have the midterm as 25% and final as 30%. However,assignments with weights as large as 15%-25% is unreasonable; feedback is given at the end of assignments, but notapplicable to future assignments making it difficult for students trying their absolute best to improve.

The average for assignments/exams is not said as theprofessor, repetitively telling students that ""it does not help you"".The material taught in this course was very interesting and applicable to the field of management. However, the way itwas taught in class and explained was poorly done. I feel that concepts were quickly explained and majority of the classwas group work. Although I can appreciate the group work and how it created discussions, I don\'t think this method wasthe best for all the material taught in class. I think this course needs some more structure and better explanations ofmaterials. It was only while studying for exams that I actually began to understand material and realise that the coursewas, in fact, interesting. The course projects were also extremely similar in nature which, I felt, didn\'t help myunderstanding of course materials at all. As management students who don\'t have a lot of experience with academicand scholarly studies, the course projects felt detatched from the course itself and unecessary.

The assignments are worth out of very little marks compared to the amount of requirements thatare tacked onto them. I feel like she did this as a way to take off extra marks. For example, the world limit for theassignment was only 1000 words but she had a significant amount of requirements to fulfill. It was difficult to satisfy herexpectations without exceeding the word count. The marking scheme is also very strange. She would make anassignment out of 41 but give us a letter grade of B/B+...How does this relate properly? How can we know our progresswhen she doesn\'t even explicitly tell us our mark? She didn\'t even tell us how much our midterm was out of. She wasvery ambiguous in stating the multiple choice questions and the short answers would be weighted differently...Onceagain how can we know our progress when she is so vague on her marking schemes?The overall quality of the instructions in the course was good. Sometimes it was bit unclear.Very well organized instruction, very stimulating material, enjoyed coming to class everyday.The instruction was very good. The prof was very engaging and found a nice balance between teaching material andpractical exercises and activities. In addition, she constantly related it back to how it would apply to industries whichwas good.In lectures, the presentation of course content and explanations were done well. I noticed however, a lack of studentparticipation and interest in the material. Participation was heavily encouraged but I saw only a slight improvement instudent participation. For this course in particular, participation is vital to truly understanding the material.Ways to increase class participation would be to implement more case studies every week during class, andincreasing the weighting and importance of participation for the final marks of students. Students, I noticed, becomemore passionate about course material when a real-life case situation is presented to them. The instructor shouldexploit this passion to give students a better learning experience. Secondly, by increasing the weighting of participationon final marks, student will be more motivated to speak in class. Also, I recommend not collecting weekly assignmentsto count for participation. Perhaps have a TA note down who participates appropriately in class and award marks in thatsense. MGMB01 taught by Professor Dewan follows a similar structure and overall class participation is at a good level.goodThis class was interestingOrganization of lecture was not the best way to teach the course material. Could be betterThe instructor\'s lectures don\'t help a lotKind of confusing and the reading material is in no way accord with the class-material. The chapter load is annoyingand frustrating since we mostly play games in class, and then basically take the course as a self-study on the side withcountless chapters.I found the course instructor to be very vague and not very responsive when approached either via email or in person.This is a problem that should be seriously addressed. The course was made a lot more confusing and harder thannecessary. For example, on the midterm examination, the teacher asked as a question but said we cannot use theexamples used in class. This was shocking as we expected the exam would allow us to apply what we had learned butthe professor started to restricted and limit our options of information. In this sense, many students found itcondescending and unfair.there wast any ""teaching"" i didn\'t really learn anything new, i felt like i should have but nopeTo be honest, it\'s probably the worst experience i ever had since i started walking and i not even exaggerating .

Mind you, the midterm did not cover all of thematerial that we had learned up to that point, only select chapters which the professor did not want to say for some oddreason. I had asked m peers before emailing her and none knew for sure what to study and I did not want to risk mymarks on what I thought I should or should not study. Clearly, I would have been better off just not asking at all. Veryrude and useless professor. Others in the course also had similar experiences, as I learned after speaking to themabout what she had said to me and how rudely she had behaved over one simple question. This made me and othersin the course hesitant to ask questions in class or outside of class and instead we went to google.

There was a lot of open discussion,which can be good, but it felt as though their was no direction to the conversation and no concepts were learned.Professor Radhakrishnan was a good lecturer; she effortlessly stimulating and engaging class discussions. Weeklynegotiation role plays were a good way of learning, but to fully capitalize on the experience, I would\'ve preferred thatwe debriefed each role play in greater detail. It would\'ve helped if we had a set of notes to following along with as wewent through debriefing questions together.I found this course to be very helpful in the field of management mainly because the course material does not stackwith any other management course. The use of negotiations is social skill we must all learn as a businessmanwhether for salary or buying a car. This course not only allowed us to learn the theory behind it, but also let uspractice it in a controlled environment. The professor demonstrated outstanding knowledge in the field and was veryhelpful. She did a superb job with the \'participation coupons\' to engage the class in discussion about negotiations.The course material itself proved to be very useful and will be of continuous use in the future. I high recommend thiscourse and also recommend that it should be added on as an elective towards the management specialist program.My only negative comment is that the time slot is very late at night.class discussion is lively and helpful, many different thoughts!the timeline of this course is very unreasonable. It makes it difficult for us when the course is only 8 weeks and thefinal exam is at the end of April. It feels like the course was designed with longer preparing time than what we hadexperienced. Each class was very rushed and materials are not well presented. I realize the course content is moredescriptive but the professor was not clear on what she is expecting from us. When asked regarding how shewanted us to present our answers, the response was very vague and unclear. When grading our assignments, theanswers she looks for are very specific and has to be her words (even if it was the same thing described in differentways). After the assignments were returned to us, she refused to tell us the average and was mad at us for askingher about the average. She did not go over the assignment with us after it was returned and there are no commentsleft on the assignment for what we had done wrong. The overall experience of this course was unpleasant.She is insightful with the examples the instructor gives. I see this material to be useful in future.The professor talks too much and repeats the same thing a hundred times. She is very close minded and doesn\'thave an open mind when listening to the students. The grading is the course is very unfair and biased. Students withthe same answers received different grades and no marking scheme is provided. I don\'t think she is a goodprofessor for negotiation as she doesn\'t have a good approach to dealing with students. She always thinks she isright and doesn\'t give students the opportunity to speak the truth or what they think. Horrible professor.not much useful concepts .. readings were useless could teach the whole course to someone in 1 hr bc its that easyOne of the worst courses I\'ve taken at UTM. I was actually interested in it since the topic seemed beneficial, but afterthe first few classes I regretted taking it instantly. The Professor was not professional at all, not worthy to be UofTprofessor. She barely taught - the entire 8 weeks consisted of the students just forming into groups and arguingcases and then taking up answers with her. She never provided examples of how to negotiate, and some of hernegotiation strategy points she made in class seemed unethical (lying to a car buyer about the car not having been inan accident even if it has?!)The method of evaluation for students was poor - one written report that was marked unnaturally hard. She also didnot give us any exam format pointers or study tips! The late timing of the class (6-9pm) on a Monday evening wasalso not helpful and participation became a bore especially with handing out ""tickets"" to participating students. It isalso very unhelpful to have a final exam an entire month after the course has ended!! Either we should have an in-class exam when the lectures finish in 8 weeks or have no exam at all.

The bane of my existence for the past semesterProfessor was patient and understandingliked the in class activities such as sugar cube construction, manager vs employee, role play etc etc. Very helpful inexperiencing the real-life application of the theories. The assignments and project was not that helpful. I found the inclass participation writings are even more reflective and helps me understand the subject materialmehGoodMaterial was good but assignments were confusing, lacked structure, excessive, and did not help me in understandingmaterial. I enjoyed the in-class participation activities part of the course and felt it was much more helpful thanassigments.I like coming to the lectures, however I think the slides could be a bit more structured to suit Engineering students.The course was quite interactive which made it interesting to attend. It would have been better if the marks that we get inthe course are regularly updated so that students have an idea of how well they are doing in the course.- For assignment 1, we did not receive any proper instructions on how the assignment should be completed until aweek before the submission date, and even then, the Professor was absent from class and she left the TAs in charge.The assignment was essentially a personality essay that required academic research, the course quickly went from afun weekly organizational lecture to this academic paper and we had no preparations for it.- The classes were long and tedious at times.Lectures were stimulating all due to Prof. Radhakrishnan. Discussions were informative and entertaining. The only thing I can suggest for improvements are the instructions in the assignments. Some parts are very vague andconfusing. Overall a fantastic course to those whom actually wants to learn about the subject.The role-play and in-class activities were stimulating for students. However, there are times where I did not learn muchout of the session as we were expected to answer questions right after activities.Also, I felt that the tutorial sessions following the lecture times are not utilized fully as it was just a filler time when thelectures become longer.She's okay, but i did not appreciate having to do all of the in-class writing. I get that people won't show up for lecturewithout it, but if the content was a little better than that wouldn't be an issue.The instruction was well organized and well paced but I feel that it was intentionally kept to a very basic level whichended up degrading the relevance of this course.Great instructionProfessor was knowledgeable, but I didn't feel like I was able to connect the material into real life.Instructions for assignments/project were not very clear. General guidelines were given on paper but the Professornever covers them in class. Only mentioning when it is due. She also does not provide assistance in interpreting theassignment, and refers to the TA's when asking any question regarding them.There are in-class assignments every lecture where we reflect on questions written a slide. On her slides, theProfessor has many rhetorical questions written, but it is not clear which ones are to be for the in-class assignments.The Professor also talks over her slides making it difficult to concentrate for the in-class assignment. I have requestedthe Professor to indicate which slides are for the assignment on the slide itself, but she seems to avoid the suggestion.   PEOPLE MGMT. & ORG.

Theywere not appropriately delved into.Extremely disorganized. Instructions unclear. Class pacing is all over the place. Expectations for assignments andprojects are not specified correctly.It\'s got interesting subject matter but the slides and documentation is presented in a very sloppy way in my opinion. Iwould have preferred more concise and focussed slides or even just a 3-5 page handout for each lecture outlining themain points so I could focus more on the discussion in class.The content coverage is kind of slack, but the structure is solid. I like the way how this course is organized, but too much""common sense"" instead of theories, quite practical though.The instructor was of low quality in comparison to the other instructors I\'ve had. Poor organizational skills. Poorpresentation skills. Did not provide stimulating projects/assignments for the students. I think she needs to be replacedQuality of the instruction was okay. The number of powerpoint and extra sheets listed on blackboard for a given lectureis a bit absurd. It was very hard to follow lectures as the instruct would constantly flip between materials without sayingwith set of slides she was currently using. All of the slides should be in one powerpoint and in the order in which theyare going to be presented. Further, our instructor did not cover all the material that was testable, instead she said toread the book, but did not provide how much of the book content we should know. The tutorial role play was not wellexecuted, and the assignments could be more reflective of the material we are learnign and less research based.I really appreciated the role-play activities, since they allowed us to practice what we learned in a controlled environmentso that we may improve on our behaviours, mentalities and approaches for real business encounters. I alsoappreciated the concise lectures, which were wholly practical and weren\'t spammed with the noise of abstractedtheories and what not. Prof. Radhakrishnan connected with us and showed her eagerness to teach us and to hear ourvoices as well, which motivated me to learn the content and to apply the positive points that I have taken away from thecourse. Overall, Prof. Radhakrishnan was engaging and made the course relevant to the students.Overall poor teaching from the professor and learning progress was low. Three main issues exist in current JRE420 course:1. Professor Radhakrishnan showed low teaching passion and negative professional attitude -- finishing class earlyfrequently; never showed up in tutorial (leave early); loosely organized course materials and course teaching.2.Inappropriate grading scheme of the course -- with 30% focus solely on one team oral presentation which does notbase on any previous written assignment. One error of an oral sentence could lead to significant change in final marksof this 400+ course. Therefore the grading on this presentation tend reflect low justice and high randomness.3. Grading process of this 30% presentation is also unreasonable -- the only two TAs were divided into twopresentations to grade the presentation individually (two sessions have different presentations going onsimultaneously) which leads to less reference in grading. And Professor Radhakrishnan herself did not show up in thepresentation session. (at least not showed up the whole time at my group\'s presentation session)8.

At this level, people weren't participatingbecause of the subject matter and pointless activities. I did not learn anything new and felt the course's assignmentswere time-wasters in a busy course schedule.The amount of emphasis the instructor put on our team was frustrating. I wholeheartedly agree that bonding withyour team is important, but in real life you will not have the opportunity to spend so much time with a single one.Therefore this course should have also emphasized adjusting to new teams rather than constantly analyzing thestrengths and weaknesses of our one team. It was redundant.Prof is great and tries hard to get the students engaged, but the students just aren't interested in learning about teambuilding.Too many reflection assignments.

I understand that for someone who is extroverted, it is difficult tolook from the POV of an introvert (and vice versa), but I would really appreciate if the professor would put some effort intounderstanding. The kind of information she is giving can be very hurtful and damaging.Very disorganized.Nearing the end of the semester and I\'m still quite not sure how all these topics converge into a useful idea, or what thepoint of the course even was.The quality of instruction was very informative and explored all aspects of the topics presented. In terms of instructionduring class, I enjoyed the format to which we spent maybe half the lecture on the presentation, some on discussionand some on role-playing/activities. It really helped to grow discussion in class and how involved we got. It was alsobeneficial that it related back to practical applications and what we as students can relate to.She did a great job making the course interactive and engaging. The class as a whole got to know each other and worktogether in many activities thanks to her. Those type of activities and engagement never happens in engineeringcourses so it really helped to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter.The quality of the teaching is good, however the subject matter I found to be quite bland and uniteresting. Although thismight be my personal opinion on the matter, i know that many other students feel this way too. The use of roleplaysgave an interesting change of pace, but it did not help to retain my interest for more than a few minutes. The use ofvideos and then analyzing them afterwards was much better at holding my attention. I find it a shame that a class taughtby a professor that clear knows the subject matter well can be so easy to tune out of. Also the length of a single lectureis simply too long. It is impossible to remain focussed and attentive for 3 hours straight.the blackboard was extremely confusing to navigatei loved the atmosphere she created in class and how she recognizes all of us and provides a lot of individual help.many other instructors do not develop individual relationships with their students. the roleplays were nice andentertaining and relating to what we learn and helped understand the course material. case studies and thepresentation were helpful too. i felt like the first assignment was not really focused into what we were learning. It wasmostly about finding the right articles rather than understanding what you were explainingReally couldn\'t understand her ppt.A feel like all of the material presented was very surface-level. We never ended up diving in to details.A great instructor, could tell that she truly wanted the class to learn. The addition of role play exercises was a great toolin making the 3 hour lectures more fun and educational.I thought that the course was well taught, the fact that we didn\'t sit in a typical lecture for 3 hours and were doinginteractive games and role plays truly helped me understand the material betterThe course material was somewhat dry, and I never had the capacity to put my full attention towards the lectures.Activities were an enjoyable learning experience, though.The marking in the course is somewhat subjective. And since the final exam will be the same for everyone, includingpeople from other lecture sections with different professors, the fact that other lecture sections are doing somethingdifferent is odd to me.please make the final easyThe professor was great, but the content of this course seemed a little... unnecessary. I might just be incredibly great atdealing with people and teams, but I felt like most of it was just common sense and I can\'t say I really /learned/anything.Phani is a good prof. The pregnant TA taught one lecture, which was absolutely horrible.I thought this course was going to teach us concepts of People Management , Organizational Behaviour, which is thename of the course. It was more of a 3 hour therapy session. Did not really learn anything except for meeting a few   PEOPLE MGMT. & ORG.

Maybe it\'s just because I don\'t really like role playing. Not everyone isexcited about doing it so most of the role playing time seemed to be wasted.The course provide pretty good explanations for all the required topics. I pretty enjoy the relaxed environment this coursehas created for me.However, the topics and exercise from this course are too theoretical. Some of the exercise won\'t work in the real life.Especially if you have already gained job experience before taking this course, you would realize that the lots of thetopics need to be adjusted for the real life situation.Overall, it\'s a good course-role play was very effective to help understand concepts -assignments/participation sheets were clear and usefulI found that the instruction documents for this course were very lengthy. It could have been more conscie, making iteasier to understand the expectations of the assignments or projects.Very good quality.The instruction quality was pretty good. The usual lecture slides are necessary but the added in class activities kept meinterested.

Prof was nice. We didn\'t have tutorials which was nice. She let us go home early. Some ofthe lectures were a bit dryInstruction of the course was great. I was not a fan of the topics but overall teaching quality was good.-lecture portion of the class was good and was kept to a good length.-loved the money activity, I learned more in that class than I have in any lecture in years.-I really disliked the format of the presentations.... tough to learn about the concepts when we had to cram all of theminto one class.

She creates a friendly atmospherein class, and is very good at condensing the material into manageable lectures that are stimulating and not energydraining or boring. Both TA's I had a positive experience with, however Anny led my tutorial so i'll primarily talk about her. She's veryengaged in the subject matter and appears to be genuinely interested during tutorial. As a result, she stimulatesreally good class discussions. She has excellent dominance over the material and is great at exemplifying its realworld use. One of THE best TA's I've had in my undergrad as wellAs a final note, both the TA's and the professor were always concerned with us bettering ourselves constantly duringthis course. They really wanted us to excelI thought the course was taught very well. The instructor structured each day of lecture to be 1/3 listening to thelecture and the other 2/3 actually applying what was discussed in the first 1/3 of the class. This kept the courseinteresting for me because it was not just sitting listening to 3 hours of lecture; we were actually learning by doing,which kept in interested in the course material.the instruction in this course is very clear and straightforward. The instructors would clarify the material as soon aspossible once there was misunderstanding.Less emphasis needs to be placed on research - more emphasis needed on negotiating and conflict resolution.It was goodCombination of lecture note and role play does help me apply things we learned to the activity and it makes materialmore interesting.The instructor went into depth in each of the assignments - what was required and how it should be presented(explaining in class). This was very helpful.The role-plays were very interesting and I was able to meet new friends. This course is very different compared toengineering courses.The instructor was okthe slides were sometimes very unclear, they lacked logical flow, important variables were often not defined justexamples were given, your method of explaining studies on slides were weirdI highly disliked these projects. The instructions for both were incredibly unclear, it was hard to understand what youwere asking, there were so many details about what you wanted scattered all over the place, the majority of the timefor both projects was spent on figuring out what this project was asking of usThe projects also seemed unrelated to this corse. As a engineering business course we want to know the subjectmaterial, we want to know how it applies to us and ways to become better leaders. And the lecture materialsdefinitely provided that but the projects did not. The projects were just learning how to do research and statisticalreferences and if we were actually majoring in organizational behaviour then learning how to read and interpret andcreate these kinds of studies would be very important to our studies. However no one in this course is looking tomajor in organizational behaviour or psychology or anything like that. We are simply engineering students who wantto take the information and studies that organizational behaviour students and researchers have conducted and put itto practical use. so for future courses it would be better for this particular course to be more learning about thematerial and how to apply it rather then doing research and studies.8.

The professor just handout the material of mock cases, and all time left is for discussion. I gainnothing from both the courses and from the professor's teaching.

What insights doe the theory provide?). Recommend to make moreexplicit in questions (ex. what do you mean by insights). Also please put due date on assignment handout rather thanjust blackboard submission link and clearer rubrics. Currently have checklist of items to include but if everything ischeckmarked is this a full marks. On individual assignment there was a sliding scale but there was little detail as towhat constituted the lowest mark vs highest possible mark in the scale other than prompting questions. Also if a studyis introduced there are many limitations to them, would be good to introduce these limitations so we can keep them inmind when looking at the results. Some of the course material and textbook make general statements too much (ex.statement in textbook that undergraduates are full of confidence/too confident, seniors are not hired much). Forexample, in the second statement, this might be true for some jobs but not highly specialized jobs (ex. surgeon,anesthesiologist) which should be taken into account when saying these statements and because we are mostlyexposed to these jobs as undergraduate engineering students.Classes were very good and learning through activities was enjoyable.

Prof assumes that everyone ""learned"" everything during lecture ,even ifmany slides were skippedShe teaches in a different way from the course coordinator, I am little worried about the exam since the stuff learnedmight be different from other section.Prof. Radhakrishnan is a very good professor. I think the most beneficial learning outcome I had from this course was updating my resume. As a fourth year student I wish I had taking this course sooner, since I think that feedback could have helped me get aPEY job. I particularly liked the weekly written reflections. I think reflecting back on material is a beneficial way to help learn thematerial that is often underused. Part of what we need to do is to give good feedback, but we also need to actually give feedback in the first place. I wonder if more students fill out course evaluations for this course since we actually learn how to provide goodfeedback in this course. I\'m struggling to think of what I would improve for this course. Perhaps it would be better if groups got to choose their presentation topics out of a slightly larger pool of topics on afirst come first serve basis? I think my group had a more difficult topic than other groups that was harder than some other groups to understand andillustrate. I\'m not sure if this is the best way to address this concern since having variety in the presentations is a good thing.Too many instructions. Instructions were way too wordy and unclear. Sometimes having only a few set of conciseinstructions are better. For the assignment and the project, it was hard to ascertain what the professor actuallyexpected. Statistics are extremely important for understanding organizational behavior and provide clearer explanations,but focusing way too much on statistics without providing us with theories and focus on intuitions behind the conceptsmade it a terrible learning experience for me as a student who did not take a statistics course, which the professorseems to assume that everyone is aware and know great deal about it. We should be given some of the core statisticalconcepts and how they are used in conducting research in the area of the course. We had to read over a lot of researchpapers with an understanding of such statistical concepts and mathematical values that explain things, which studentshad to make a lot of effort into understanding them.ExcellentThe lecture is too abstract. There is no concrete information being taught in lecture and although lecture is entertaining,it is not directly related to the course content.The course was taught as more of a psychology course rather than a management course, I think the opportunity isthere to teach some great tangible skills but there is too much of a focus on the academic aspect rather than thepractical industry aspect.8.

I have never seensuch level of emails from an instruction ever in any sort of studies in trying to understand what the instructor is trying toteach which is the job of the instructor. The professor seemed to have different perceptions for different students or how she seems to prefer some studentsover other students, which were clear on how she handled different questions brought up by different students after theend of the lecture. I am not sure why I actually had to feel that I was treated poorly when clarifying some of the stuffs thatother students also seem to ask but were treated fairly. Without the teaching assistants who were very informative andhelpful in clarifying them, I would have probably dropped the course and had taken a different course.   PEOPLE MGMT. & ORG.

It doesn\'t help clear up anything. And essentially that makes me haveto make an assumption about the assignment which could be completely wrong and therefore be graded poorly for it.Even if I were to use logic to determine the correct assumption based on the wording of the assignment, the wordingitself could be different from what the professor/TA meant to say. So I could again be graded poorly for it. I asked thequestion in the first place because I wanted a concrete answer such that there\'s no ambiguity.

However, at times, this deterred the overall quality of instruction when core topics about labour unions,relationships between stakeholders in union environments, etc. could not be covered during class time. However, towards the endof the semester when we started working on the work integrated learning project, the quality of learning by doing was veryenjoyable.For starters,the final assignment was not about Industrial relations, it was about recruitment. Although, the project was interesting, itfelt frustrating to do a project that was not entirely related to the course. The coolest part about this course was the arbitration lecturewhere is was a grievance procedure. That was quite interesting. The class discussions were interesting too. But, I wish thebeginning of the course had a better start towards lecture based learning. It felt extremely boring and a lack of structure. Personallyspeaking from my learning style, I found having discussions THROUGHOUT the lecture was not as helpful to being able to retainthe knowledge. Instead simple questions to trigger into the next topic, or after the lecture about the material is provided we have adiscussion. To have a discussion while the lecture is going made it hard to pinpoint what were points she actually wanted us tolearn vs. what the students are saying and trying to understand if the discussion is a tangent away from the course material for theday or part of the course material. There lecture slides were from the ""supplementary"" textbook and not the first recommendedtextbook, which felt frustrating. The concept of not sure which textbook to read, especially when having only 1, was frustrating aswell. Additionally, the weekly assignments felt irritating with how extensive they were, but I also understand that it was part ofwanting to have deep discussions during class. Maybe bi\xe2\x80\x93weekly might be better to not irritate the students.As a person, she is a very nice and kind person who means well. For that I am grateful. But I believe there is a disconnect there inthe way she teaches and presents herself to students. It almost feels as though she lacks sensitivity to social situations and has alot of favouritism towards particular students, which feels intimating for other students to want to participate. Again, I don\'t mean to say all of this in a spiteful way, she does seem like a kind person who wants to teach and motivate students,but her intent is not being produced into the impact she is looking for.It feels weird to recommend this to a professor, but if she could receive some sort of training with how to better be able to translateher intent for the students into that same impact for students. I\'m sure I am not the only student who feels this way in this course. The other students are probably writing more angry coursereviews.But overall, the course felt frustrating for the most part, but I cannot deny that I learned through the class lectures and weeklyassignments, and group arbitration case. Additionally, even though the final group project was not related to industrial relations, itwas interesting to learn about Women in STEM and Leadership.I hope professor could provide more information on course materials rather than group discussion because the materials in thiscourse is quite hard to understandProf really cares for her students. Prof really wanted students to understand concepts and relate it to real life situations.Prof made great efforts to help students do well esp with the Covid situation.In\xe2\x80\x93class discussions were very interesting (although sometimes went off\xe2\x80\x93topic) and in\xe2\x80\x93class activities were also engaging andpractical (negotiation and arbitration). The tests were relevant to the course material but it wasn\'t really covered in class (because ofthe off\xe2\x80\x93topic discussions) and the project also did not seem to relate to the course either.I think that the exams are too long, 44 MC is too much to do with the LA in that amount of time. I think the exam should be shortenedin terms of multiple choice. I also think the course project had little to do with industrial relations and seemed like more of arecruitment project. I would rather more interactive classes like the ones where we had debates and have higher participationmarks and maybe all long answer or long answer and only a few MC. There is also too many lecture slides and it is confusing andoverwhelming. I think the lecture slides should be much lessHer exams are unnecessarily long and does not give enough time to finish them.Her final project was not related to the course but it was related to different courses one which many students did not takeLong lecture slides that are not used and since the exams are open books it causes waste of money on printing material that is notused during exams.It seems she is not familiar with the topics, concepts are not explained clearly, does not answer questions clearly.Intro to Industrial Relations Labour Issues-S-LEC01-Phanikiran Radhakrishnan-4/3/2020 4/168.

It is so ironic, that we discussed about the topic ""feedback"", but the prof never seem tochange her teaching style. Have you ever put yourself at the students position and listen to a recording of yourself teaching? Haveyou considered looking on the reviews on RateMyProf? because I can confirm that your teaching is an utter mess. You keep onasking so many questions in the lectures, are you actually teaching? or are you just making us students more confused? What isthe point of coming to lectures, if the objective of your teaching is to ask us questions that we don\'t know the answers to. Are theSTUDENTS teaching the class or are YOU teaching the class? I also do not see the purpose in coming to your office hours, youshould have already explained everything clearly in the lecture. Role plays and discussions are useless, that time could have beenbetter used by you teaching and explaining MORE, instead of asking students.

However, I did not find the powerpointsuseful because there is always a lot of information on the slides and that is not properly organized as evidenced by the largenumber of slides per class (40\xe2\x80\x9360 slides). She does add some statistics and graphs which slightly improves our learning.Teaching Style: she doesn't do a lot of teaching because she mostly reads off her notes on the powerpoint slides, which makes itdifficult for us to stay focused because speaks pretty fast and rarely stops. I found it more useful to read the textbook on my own, butI found it unfair that she expected us to read sometimes 2\xe2\x80\x933 chapters per week given that they were on average 30\xe2\x80\x9350 pages. Forexample: the final exam was only two weeks apart from the midterm, but she expected us to read 2\xe2\x80\x933 chapters 1 week, and 2\xe2\x80\x933chapters the next week.I did not learn anything valuable from this course. The instructions of course work were often unclear and vague. Overall, I did nothave a good experience with this course and the corresponding professor.The course about recruitment and selection was interesting. The material about reliability and validity were very challenging to learn,but was a interesting concept. But, I wish the beginning of the course had a better start towards lecture based learning. It felt extremely boring and a lack ofstructure. Personally speaking from my learning style, I found having discussions THROUGHOUT the lecture was not as helpful tobeing able to retain the knowledge. Instead simple questions to trigger into the next topic, or after the lecture about the material isprovided we have a discussion. To have a discussion while the lecture is going made it hard to pinpoint what were points sheactually wanted us to learn vs. what the students are saying and trying to understand if the discussion is a tangent away from thecourse material for the day or part of the course material. No complaints against lectures that were purely discussion basedthough. Its just for the ones where discussion with lecture/chapter material.As a person, she is a very nice and kind person who means well. For that I am grateful. But I believe there is a disconnect there inthe way she teaches and presents herself to students. It almost feels as though she lacks sensitivity to social situations and has alot of favouritism towards particular students, which feels intimating for other students to want to participate. Again, I don't mean to say all of this in a spiteful way, she does seem like a kind person who wants to teach and motivate students,but her intent is not being translated into the impact she is looking for.It feels weird to recommend this to a professor, but if she could receive some sort of training with how to better be able to translateher intent for the students into that same impact for students.But overall, I entered this course with high expectations to learn about recruitment and selection but it was not a very structuredcourse for me to follow, but i do understand this may be a result of my learning style as some may prefer this more free\xe2\x80\x93flowing anddiscussion based lecture style.The professor is so so so bad, the final report's instruction is very unclear.The exams and assignments were relevant to the course. The homework was sometimes a lot of work to do in one week. The labsessions did not seem to relate to any of the assessments (exams or assignments). The assignment had a lot of requirements forthe constraints provided (professor/course requirements and employer requirements) fit into 8\xe2\x80\x93page written report and 15\xe2\x80\x93minutepresentation.Extremely long exams with not enough time to completeExtremely long lectures that are not helpful at allShe does not explain concepts clearly, does not answer questions clearlyShe seems like she is not familiar with the topics of the courseWasted classroom time on a program that we did not have any access to outside of one specific classroom, thus we could notpractice was learned.

I reallyenjoyed the last project for this course as it is relating to the current covid\xe2\x80\x9319 topic regarding the vaccine this allowed me to havethe opportunity to research a lot about the vaccine situation regarding another country. I had a really great time working with mygroup and as well as researching to come up with a solution for the problem that the country is facing regarding vaccines.Professor was enthusiastic about the material, but the final project breakdown could have been a bit clearer. Some sections werevague and asked questions that were difficult to obtain information on.Not great.

She makes learning super easy, doesn't complicate things. Slides are detailed which is very muchneeded in a university environment and really aids our learning overall.I did not like Professor Rs style of teaching. She did not explain concepts well which is fine because we can learn it ourselves butshe did also did not explain assignments well at all. She has weekly journals due after class and is very confusing as to what weneed to answer in those journals. Nobody really knows what is going on in this class half the time as she is all over the place. Weuse multiple programs at once (Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Idecision games) so it is very overwhelming. She also posts1921001921 different links for each class and multiple powerpoints dating back to 2017. Overall, I'm not sure if I learned anything inthis class.The material and lectures were interesting. I recommend not using I decision because a lot of people had issues. however, thebreakout rooms on Zoom were very helpful.i really enjoyed DR.R's class, the materials are interesting and the way she delivers them is also really fun.The course session and instruction are very ambiguous and cause so many confusion. The content layout are very messy. The in\xe2\x80\x93class engagement is very poor due to those ambiguous and every student has no idea what is going 80% of the time. pretty muchthe class environment is very discouraging for learning due to all confusions Not instructive for the lectures. Everything learned are from self\xe2\x80\x93reading o journals. Up to now, I have no idea what is expected to geta good mark or what is expect to be in exam and how are we going to elaborate in exam.........The IDG is a really cool experience that allow us to work with peers while having online lectures.However, the time zone issue can be a problem for some students. For example, I will have to wake up at 2am to attend the class,so maybe having some alternative will be great. However, I do enjoy the class participation and discussion and class activity.With all the roleplays and simulations I was able to understand how to apply the concepts we learned in lectureWay too many platforms being used in this course. idecisiongames was not necessary\xe2\x80\x93 it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work 75% of the time. Prof is very enthusiastic and creates interesting lectures :)Fun class. GoodThere is a lot of work before and after the lecture.The quality of instruction in this course was great and I really enjoyed the different way of learning. I enjoyed the role\xe2\x80\x93play activitiesand the group project as they allowed us to think outside the box and try something different from previous courses.The multiple online platforms used makes my learning experience not very good. Too many apps make it hard to get discussionpartners.8.

As for thecourse material, I really enjoyed being able to discuss with my classmates and learning through conversation and the professor'ssummary at the end of class + the reflection journals as opposed to just reading articles or textbooks. In the future, I think having amore clear outline of what concepts we should have a good grasp of and what the final exam will be like would be helpful to thesuccess of those taking the class. But overall, I really appreciate Professor Radhakrishnan's efforts for this course \xe2\x80\x93 which was veryevident!I enjoyed the class discussion and cases we covered in the course since it gave me new perspectivesProfessor Radhakrishnan managed to make this course very interactive and interesting. She taught concepts through activities thatwere very eye\xe2\x80\x93opening and engaging. She clearly explained concepts and connected the activities to concepts.The prof relied on case studies and in class exercises for the majority of the course work on top of the readings. All of these weregreat because these exercises and cases really challenged our understanding of the class concepts through detailed discussionsand debates.The final group project was also really helpful in helping us further apply the course concepts to a real world problem: Tacklingvaccine hesitancy8.
